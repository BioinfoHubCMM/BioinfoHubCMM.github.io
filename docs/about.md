## About

The Bioinformatics Hub (BioinforHub) at the Center for Molecular Medicine (CMM) at Karolinska Institutet was established in 2024. We aim to foster collaboration and discussion within the bioinformatics community. The hub hosts bi-monthly lunch workshops and organizes engaging social events, creating a vibrant space for knowledge sharing and networking.
